\section{Methodology}
In order to perform analysis on the available data we used \verb|R studio|. After loading the datasets to a suitable dataframe format rigorous cleanup was performed since the data was not ideal for our scope of analysis. After we got the cleaned data for each analysis and/or step statistical analysis and shaping were performed so that it becomes easy to interface the data to its related tool such as \verb|plotly|, \verb|ggplot|. After feeding the shaped data to these tools we get human-readable visualizations that can be easily interpreted and inferred. Sections below are the observations we have found from our analysis.
