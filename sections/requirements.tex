%% will change this section
  \item Since this project aims to work alongside AIHW the team has considered AIHW as their primary data source. Although, the data available on the AIHW website are summary or aggregated data and it does not include individual records. Their 3 primary data sources which are National Perinatal Data Collection, National Perinatal Mortality Data Collection \& National Maternal Mortality Data Collection’s data can be accessed by making a request with table specifications to the data provider.
  \item Our team wants to use the Australian Bureau of Statistics data on birth as a secondary dataset. These datasets have records from 1991-2021 of birth data. It includes the data describing the parent’s birthplace, age, ethnicity if they are aboriginal, birthrate of the area, etc which can play vital roles in this project’s analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Budget}
The allocated budget of AUD300 was not used since the data was not accessible and a request for data was not made as our sponsor indicated that by the time our request would be fulfilled and get the data in our hands, the project will also reach its deadline.
