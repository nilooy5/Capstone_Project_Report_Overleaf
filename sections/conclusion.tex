\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the analysis of Australia's mothers and newborns data reveals several crucial insights into the health outcomes of mothers and infants in the country. The study highlights the negative impact of maternal smoking on perinatal and neonatal mortality rates, stillbirths, and other adverse birth outcomes. Additionally, the research shows that a range of socio-demographic factors, including maternal age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, also play a significant role in determining maternal and infant health outcomes.

Overall, the findings of this study emphasize the importance of targeted public health interventions aimed at reducing maternal smoking rates and addressing other risk factors that contribute to adverse birth outcomes. By prioritizing the health and wellbeing of mothers and their newborns, policymakers and healthcare professionals can work towards improving maternal and child health outcomes in Australia and around the world.
