\section{Recommendations to the Sponsor}
In our opinion, our sponsor was extremely helpful and communicative. Our sponsor gave us the freedom of choice about what analysis we come up with, what can be the outcome and what are the deliverables. The sponsor also helped the team communicate with the dataset owners from the government agencies which as AIHW. She suggested that should not wait for 2 months for AIHW to give us a fraction of the atomic dataset they own and start working on the aggregated dataset that is publicly accessible. However, the team understands that the analysis would have been more specific if there was access to a more workable dataset that is not aggregated which would allow the team to make better analyses and models for forecasting.
