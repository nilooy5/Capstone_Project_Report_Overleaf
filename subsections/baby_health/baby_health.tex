\subsection{Baby \& Mother's Health}
The baby's and mother's health is an important factor during and after childbirth. Successful childbirth often depends on some key factors of the baby's health such as gestational age, the weight of the baby when it was born, etc. To analyze this we looked into the Australian dataset (figure \ref{fig:bmi_au}) and we can observe that the majority of the babies were underweight at the time they were born. It can often happen as sometimes doctors suggest mothers be conservative about eating during the last stage of pregnancy as the labour can become very difficult if the baby is overweight \emph{[citation needed]}.

Below are the findings we get after analysing data that focuses on ACT data only.
