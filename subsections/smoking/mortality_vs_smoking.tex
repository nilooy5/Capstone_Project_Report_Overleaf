\subsubsection{Mortality vs Smoking}
As we have discussed previously, smoking is directly related to mortality rate, we came up with an analysis that visualizes how smoking affects different categories of deaths.
We can see in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:smoking-mortality}} that neonatal death is the highest among mothers who smoked during pregnancy.
