\subsection{Smoking Habits Among Mothers}
The mothers' smoking habit during pregnancy can have a range of negative effects on both the mother and the developing fetus. Some of the potential effects of smoking during pregnancy include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Increased risk of miscarriage: Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, especially during the first trimester.
    \item Preterm delivery: Smoking during pregnancy can increase the risk of delivering the baby before 37 weeks of gestation, which can lead to a range of health problems for the baby.
    \item Low birth weight: Babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to have a low birth weight, which can lead to a range of health problems, including developmental delays, infections, and breathing difficulties.
    \item Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): Babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy are at a higher risk of SIDS, which is the sudden and unexplained death of an otherwise healthy baby.
    \item Respiratory problems: Smoking during pregnancy can cause respiratory problems for the developing fetus, including asthma and other lung diseases.
    \item Behavioral problems: Children born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy may be more likely to experience behavioral problems, such as ADHD and conduct disorder.
\end{enumerate}

It's important for mothers to quit smoking during pregnancy to protect the health of their developing fetus and their own health as well. If you're a smoker and pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting smoking and improving the health of your baby.

In overall Australia, we can see \textbf{(figure \ref{fig:smoking_au})} that mothers who smoked has increased in number.

Oppositely \textbf{figure \ref{fig:smoking_prop}} we can see that smoking was quite common among mothers of ACT in 2001 but the rate steadily decreased and came down to less than 5\% in recent years.
