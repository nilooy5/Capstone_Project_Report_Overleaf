\subsubsection{Smoker's Age in ACT}
We wanted to find out the correlation between mothers who smoke and their age among the mothers who live in ACT (\textbf{figure \ref{fig:smoking_age}}). We can see that smoking is more common among young mothers. Mothers aged 15-19 are significant in number when it comes to smoking habits. The rate falls drastically as the age increases.
