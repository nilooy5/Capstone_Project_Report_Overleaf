\subsection{Method of Birth}
Methods of birth can be classified into 4 categories. They are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cesarean section
    \item Vaginal (forceps)
    \item Vaginal (non-instrumental)
    \item Vaginal (vacuum)
\end{enumerate}
If we look at the overall data in Figure \ref{fig:method_au} of Australia we can see that as time passed all of these births of different methods are increasing but the number of vaginal birth has increased more over time in comparison with other methods.
