\subsection{Neonatal \& Perinatal Deaths and Stillbirths}
Neonatal refers to the first 28 days of life after birth. This is a critical period for the baby's development, and neonatal care is essential to ensure their survival and well-being.

Perinatal refers to the period of time surrounding the birth of a baby, typically starting at 22 weeks of gestation and ending seven days after birth. This period includes both the antepartum (before birth) and intrapartum (during birth) periods.

Stillbirth is the term used when a baby is born without signs of life after 20 weeks of gestation. This can happen before, during, or after delivery. Stillbirth is a devastating loss for parents and families and is often a traumatic experience.

In Australia, perinatal deaths are relatively rare, but they remain a significant public health issue.

If we look at the Australia-wide data \textbf{figure \ref{fig:neo-rate}}, \textbf{figure \ref{fig:peri-rate}} \& \textbf{figure \ref{fig:still-rate}} we can see that the neonatal, perinatal, and stillbirth rate are decreasing through the years
