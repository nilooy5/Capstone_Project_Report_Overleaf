\subsection{Age of Mothers}
Our first aim was to have an overall understanding of the mothers' age group and their proportions. After performing some statistical analysis we get two figures that show the trends of mothers of different age groups in different states as well as overall Australia. It can be observed that in most Australian states women who are aged less than 20 make the most proportion of mothers. After them, mothers who are 40 or more make up the 2nd largest age group (figure \ref{fig:age0.1}). Mothers from the age group of 20-24 make up the second biggest sample if we look at individual data from different states (figure \ref{fig:age0.2}). However, in (Figure: \ref{fig:age1}) ACT we see a different trend in data. We can see that the age group of 15-19 and over 40 are the last 2 age groups while most mothers are from the age group of 30-34.
