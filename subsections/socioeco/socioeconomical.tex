\subsection{Socioeconomic Status}
Socioeconomic status can play a crucial role in terms of the ability to afford healthcare, access to doctors \& medication, healthy food etc. Interestingly, in figure \ref{fig:socioecoau} we can see that through the years the most disadvantaged mothers had babies. To have a deeper insight we looked into state-based data. We can see (figure\ref{fig:socioecostates}) different trends in different states. We can observe that in some states such as ACT, NSW \& NT more advantaged the mothers are more interested they are in having babies. Interestingly, we can see the opposite trend in QLD, SA \& Tasmania where often the least advantaged mothers tend to have more babies.
